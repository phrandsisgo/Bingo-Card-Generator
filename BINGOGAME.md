Welcome to the unofficial Sziget Challenge Bingo game! This fun activity will enhance your festival experience by encouraging you to explore, interact, and create memorable moments during your time at Sziget.

## What is This?

This is a digital bingo card generator that creates unique challenge cards for Sziget Festival attendees. Each card contains a mix of easy and hard challenges to complete during the festival, plus one special "joker" challenge that's particularly difficult.

## How to Play

1. Generate your personal bingo card by loading the HTML file in your browser
2. Complete the challenges on your card during the festival
3. Mark off each challenge as you complete it
4. Try to complete the entire card (except the joker challenge, which is optional)
5. When you've completed all regular challenges, shout "BINGO!"

## Rules

- Each challenge must be completed by you personally
- Document your completed challenges (photos are great proof!)
- Be respectful of other festival-goers, staff, and the environment
- No illegal activities allowed
- The game should enhance your experience, not replace it - enjoy the music and community first!

## How to Win

The first two Szitizens who complete their entire bingo card (all regular challenges) will win a small prize package sent directly from Switzerland! To claim your prize:

1. Take a photo of your completed bingo card
2. Send proof of your completed challenges (photos/videos)
3. Contact me via:
    - Email: [your-email@example.com]
    - Instagram: [@yourusername]
    - During the festival: [optional contact info]
